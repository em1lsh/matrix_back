SYSTEM METRICS - Production Load Test
======================================
Test: 10,000 concurrent users, 5 minutes

CONTAINER METRICS (After Test)
-------------------------------
Container: backend-app-test-1
CPU Usage: 2.09%
Memory Usage: 231.1 MiB / 15.54 GiB (1.45%)
Network I/O: 231 MB received / 243 MB sent
Block I/O: 0B / 0B

OBSERVATIONS
------------
✓ CPU usage low after test (2.09%)
✓ Memory usage reasonable (231 MB)
✓ Network throughput: ~474 MB total
✗ High CPU during test (warning issued by Locust)

RESOURCE ANALYSIS
-----------------
- Application not CPU-bound (2% usage after test)
- Memory footprint acceptable (231 MB)
- Network handled 474 MB of traffic
- Connection pool likely the bottleneck
- Database connections may be limiting factor

BOTTLENECK IDENTIFICATION
-------------------------
Primary Bottleneck: Connection Pool Exhaustion
- 96% failure rate with ConnectionAbortedError
- System resources (CPU/Memory) not maxed out
- Network bandwidth sufficient
- Likely database connection limit reached

Secondary Issues:
- Locust client machine CPU overload
- Single machine generating 10,000 users
- Connection handling in application

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------
1. Increase database connection pool size
2. Implement connection pooling optimization
3. Use distributed Locust testing (multiple workers)
4. Add connection timeout configuration
5. Monitor database connection metrics
