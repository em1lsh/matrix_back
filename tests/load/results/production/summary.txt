PRODUCTION LOAD TEST RESULTS - 10,000 Concurrent Users
================================================================
Test Date: 2025-12-02
Duration: 5 minutes
Users: 10,000 concurrent
Spawn Rate: 100 users/second

OVERALL PERFORMANCE
-------------------
Total Requests: 191,165
Total Failures: 184,160 (96.34%)
Success Rate: 3.66%
Requests/Second: 632.94 RPS

RESPONSE TIMES
--------------
Average: 10,059ms (10 seconds)
Median: 29ms
95th Percentile: 46,000ms (46 seconds)
99th Percentile: 53,000ms (53 seconds)
Max: 82,870ms (83 seconds)

CRITICAL FINDINGS
-----------------
⚠️ SYSTEM OVERLOAD - The application cannot handle 10,000 concurrent users
⚠️ 96.34% failure rate indicates severe capacity issues
⚠️ Average response time of 10 seconds is unacceptable
⚠️ Most failures due to connection errors (ConnectionAbortedError, ConnectionResetError)

ERROR BREAKDOWN
---------------
Connection Errors: ~180,000 (97.7% of failures)
- ConnectionAbortedError: Majority of errors
- ConnectionResetError: Secondary error type
- RemoteDisconnected: Minimal occurrences

Application Errors: ~750 (0.4% of failures)
- 500 Server Errors: 
  * POST /market/floor: 281 failures
  * GET /offers/my: 192 failures
  * POST /auctions/ (list): 99 failures
- 404 Not Found:
  * POST /presale/ (list): 92 failures
  * GET /users/balance-topups: 86 failures

ENDPOINTS WITH HIGHEST FAILURE RATES
-------------------------------------
1. POST /market/ (list items): 29,968 connection errors
2. GET /accounts: 15,882 connection errors
3. GET /nft/my: 11,965 connection errors
4. POST /market/ (with filters): 10,004 connection errors
5. GET /market/collections: 7,972 connection errors

SUCCESSFUL ENDPOINTS (100% success during test)
------------------------------------------------
✓ GET /offers/my - 4,539 requests (before connection failures)
✓ POST /market/floor - 6,830 requests (before connection failures)
✓ POST /auctions/ (list) - 2,326 requests (before connection failures)
✓ POST /presale/ (list) - 2,295 requests (before connection failures)
✓ GET /users/balance-topups - 2,329 requests (before connection failures)

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
--------------------
✗ System cannot handle 10,000 concurrent users
✗ Connection pool exhausted
✗ Database connections likely maxed out
✗ Server resources (CPU/Memory) overwhelmed
✗ Network bandwidth saturated
✓ Response times good for successful requests (29ms median)
✓ Application logic works when not overloaded

SYSTEM WARNINGS
---------------
⚠️ CPU usage was too high during the test
⚠️ Locust recommends distributing load over multiple machines
⚠️ Single machine cannot generate 10,000 concurrent users effectively

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------
1. IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
   - Reduce target concurrent users to realistic levels (100-500)
   - Implement connection pooling optimization
   - Add database connection limits
   - Configure proper timeouts

2. INFRASTRUCTURE:
   - Scale horizontally (add more app servers)
   - Implement load balancer
   - Increase database connection pool
   - Add caching layer (Redis)
   - Use CDN for static content

3. APPLICATION:
   - Optimize slow queries
   - Add database indexes
   - Implement request queuing
   - Add rate limiting
   - Optimize connection handling

4. TESTING:
   - Use distributed load testing (multiple Locust workers)
   - Test with realistic user counts (100-1000)
   - Gradual ramp-up testing
   - Monitor system resources during tests

REALISTIC CAPACITY ESTIMATE
----------------------------
Based on previous successful tests:
- Stable Performance: 50 concurrent users @ 24 RPS
- Good Performance: 20 concurrent users @ 10 RPS
- Estimated Max Capacity: 100-200 concurrent users

NEXT STEPS
----------
1. Run realistic load test with 100-500 users
2. Implement infrastructure improvements
3. Optimize database queries and connections
4. Add monitoring and alerting
5. Implement auto-scaling
6. Re-test after optimizations
