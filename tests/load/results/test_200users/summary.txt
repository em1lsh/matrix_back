LOAD TEST RESULTS - 200 Concurrent Users (Complete Coverage)
================================================================
Test Date: 2025-12-02
Duration: 10 minutes
Users: 200 concurrent
Spawn Rate: 10 users/second
Endpoints: 35+ (complete coverage)

CRITICAL FAILURE
================
⚠️ SYSTEM COMPLETELY FAILED - 100% FAILURE RATE
⚠️ ALL REQUESTS TIMED OUT AT 30 SECONDS
⚠️ SYSTEM CANNOT HANDLE 200 USERS WITH FULL ENDPOINT COVERAGE

OVERALL PERFORMANCE
-------------------
Total Requests: 3,475
Total Failures: 3,475 (100%)
Success Rate: 0%
Requests/Second: 5.80 RPS

RESPONSE TIMES
--------------
Average: 30,010ms (30 seconds - TIMEOUT)
Median: 30,001ms (30 seconds - TIMEOUT)
95th Percentile: 30,000ms (30 seconds - TIMEOUT)
99th Percentile: 30,000ms (30 seconds - TIMEOUT)
Max: 30,044ms (30 seconds - TIMEOUT)

ERROR ANALYSIS
--------------
All 3,475 requests failed with:
ConnectionResetError(10054, 'Удаленный хост принудительно разорвал существующее подключение')

This indicates:
- Server is completely overwhelmed
- Connection pool exhausted
- Database connections maxed out
- System resources depleted
- Network stack overloaded

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
-------------------
1. CONNECTION POOL EXHAUSTION
   - System ran out of available connections
   - All new requests queued indefinitely
   - 30-second timeout triggered for all requests

2. DATABASE BOTTLENECK
   - Too many concurrent database queries
   - Connection pool size insufficient
   - Query execution blocked

3. SYSTEM RESOURCE DEPLETION
   - CPU/Memory/Network overwhelmed
   - Unable to process new requests
   - System entered deadlock state

4. NO GRACEFUL DEGRADATION
   - System did not handle overload gracefully
   - No request queuing or rate limiting
   - Complete system failure instead of partial degradation

COMPARISON WITH PREVIOUS TESTS
-------------------------------
- 50 users (Stage 3): 94% success, 24ms avg response
- 200 users (this test): 0% success, 30,000ms avg response
- Conclusion: System breaks between 50-200 concurrent users

CRITICAL ISSUES
---------------
1. ⚠️ No connection pooling limits
2. ⚠️ No request timeout handling
3. ⚠️ No rate limiting
4. ⚠️ No graceful degradation
5. ⚠️ No load balancing
6. ⚠️ No caching layer
7. ⚠️ No request queuing
8. ⚠️ Insufficient database connections

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED
---------------------------
1. STOP production deployment - system not ready
2. Implement connection pooling with limits
3. Add request timeouts (< 30 seconds)
4. Implement rate limiting per user
5. Add Redis caching layer
6. Optimize database queries
7. Add connection pool monitoring
8. Implement circuit breakers

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------
DO NOT RUN 10,000 USER TEST
- System cannot handle 200 users
- 10,000 users will cause complete system crash
- May damage database or infrastructure
- No value in testing beyond capacity

REALISTIC CAPACITY
------------------
Current Maximum: 50-100 concurrent users
Target Capacity: 500-1000 concurrent users
Gap: 5-10x improvement needed

NEXT STEPS
----------
1. Implement basic infrastructure improvements
2. Test with 100 users to find exact breaking point
3. Add monitoring and alerting
4. Implement caching and connection pooling
5. Re-test incrementally (100, 150, 200 users)
6. Only test higher loads after passing 200 users

CONCLUSION
----------
✗ TEST FAILED COMPLETELY
✗ System not production-ready for any significant load
✗ Critical infrastructure improvements required
✗ Do not proceed with 10,000 user test
