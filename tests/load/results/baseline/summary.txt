LOAD TESTING SUMMARY - BASELINE
========================================

Test Configuration:
- Users: 50 concurrent
- Spawn Rate: 5 users/sec
- Duration: 10 minutes
- Host: http://localhost:8001

Results:
--------
Total Requests: 14,886
Requests/sec: 24.83 RPS
Success Rate: 0% (404 errors - endpoints not implemented)

Response Times:
- Average: 2.83ms
- Median: 3.00ms
- 95th percentile: 4.00ms
- 99th percentile: 5.00ms
- Max: 75.42ms

Infrastructure Status:
- Database: MySQL 8 (healthy)
- Cache: Redis 7 (healthy)
- App: FastAPI + Uvicorn (healthy)

Notes:
- All requests return 404 because API endpoints are not fully implemented
- Response times are excellent (< 5ms for 99% of requests)
- System handles 25 RPS with 50 concurrent users smoothly
- No crashes or timeouts observed

Next Steps:
- Implement missing API endpoints
- Run tests again to measure real performance
- Compare with optimized version after refactoring
